      <h3>Project 1: Eco - Friendly Campus Navigation App</h3>
      <p>Description: This is a navigation app specifically designed for campuses with an emphasis on environmental features. It not only provides users with the optimal walking route navigation between buildings and facilities on campus, but also recommends the use of environmentally friendly travel methods during navigation, such as encouraging the use of green trails on campus and avoiding roads with heavy traffic to reduce carbon emissions. At the same time, the application integrates the information of garbage sorting points on campus, which is convenient for users to classify garbage on the way. Through this project, students apply mobile application development skills, including the use of map apis, interface design, and the integration and presentation of environmental data, with the aim of promoting environmental awareness and mobility on campus.</p>
